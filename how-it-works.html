  <title>How It Works — Reytech Reserve</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>How Reytech Reserve Works</h1>

<p>
Reytech Reserve is a commission-based digital savings infrastructure designed
to help individuals build disciplined, long-term reserves without exposure to
speculation, leverage, or interest-based systems.
</p>

<h2>Step 1 — Deposit</h2>
<p>
Users allocate funds into the Reytech Reserve system through approved channels.
Funds are held in segregated, custodial environments and are never mixed with
operational assets.
</p>

<h2>Step 2 — Safeguarding</h2>
<p>
The system prioritizes capital preservation. There is no trading, lending,
yield farming, or interest generation. Reytech Reserve does not promise returns.
</p>

<h2>Step 3 — Transparency</h2>
<p>
All rules are predefined. Fees are clear, fixed, and disclosed upfront.
There are no hidden conditions, performance claims, or profit expectations.
</p>

<h2>Step 4 — Withdrawal</h2>
<p>
Users may exit the system according to the predefined rules. Early exits may
incur a clearly stated service fee, designed to discourage impulsive behavior.
</p>

<p>
Reytech Reserve is not a bank, not an investment product, and not a financial
advisory service. It is a digital discipline framework.
